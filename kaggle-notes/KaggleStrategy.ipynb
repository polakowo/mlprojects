    "    \n",
    "- To learn more about an interesting problem: \n",
    "    - You may want the competition to have a wide discussion on the forums. \n",
    "    - For example, if you are interested in data science with application to medicine, try to predict [lung cancer in the Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017) or [seizures in long-term human intracranial EEG recordings]((https://www.kaggle.com/c/melbourne-university-seizure-prediction)).\n",
    "- To get acquainted with new software tools: \n",
    "    - You may want the competition to have required tutorials. \n",
    "    - For example, if you want to learn a neural networks library, choose any of the competitions with images like the [The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) or [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space).\n",
    "- To hunt for a medal: \n",
    "    - Check how many submissions do participants have. \n",
    "    - If the points that people have over hundred submissions, it can be a clear sign of inconsistency of local validation and leaderboard scores. \n",
    "    - On the other hand, if there are people with few submissions in the top, that usually means there should be a non-trivial approach to this competition or it's discovered only by few people. \n",
    "    - If leaderboard mostly consists of teams with only one participant, you'll probably have enough chances if you gather a good team."

    "- Never join a competition at its very beginning:\n",

    "    - How BIG is data (what computational resources do you need)?\n",
    "    - What is the metric is being testing on? Find a similar competition.\n",

    "    - Check the data for leakages (and discrepancies between train and test).\n",
    "    - Plot features versus the target variable and time (if available).\n",
    "    - Consider univariate predictability metrics (IV, R, AUC).\n",
    "    - Binning numerical features and correlation matrices.\n",
    "- Build a simple (or even primitive) baseline:\n",
    "    - Often you can find baseline solutions provided by organizers or in kernels.\n",
    "    - Start rather with RF than with GBMs.\n",
    "    - At least Random Forest works quite fast and requires almost no tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Decide on the correct cross-validation scheme:\n",
    "    - *People have won just by selecting the right way to validate.*\n",
    "    - Is time important? Time-based validation.\n",
    "    - New entities in test? Stratified validation.\n",
    "    - Otherwise random K-fold strategy.\n",
    "    - Check if validation is stable (i.e. correlates with public LB score).\n",
    "- Debug the full pipeline:\n",
    "    - From loading data to writing a submission file.\n",
    "- After trying the problem individually, explore the public kernels and forums:\n",
    "    - Other participants have different approaches resulting in diversity.\n",
    "- Proceed from simple to complex:\n",
    "    - Add features in bulks (create many features at once).\n",
    "- Perform hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "    - When tuning parameters, first try to make the model to overfit.\n",
    "- Perform ensembling:\n",
    "    - Proceed with ensembling only after feature engineering is done.\n",
    "- Select the best on LB and the best submission locally (or the most diverse one)."
