The [Credit Card Fraud Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) was a perfect match for learning about state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. In this project, we trained an autoencoder to detect fraudulent credit card transactions and compared its performance to other methods.
